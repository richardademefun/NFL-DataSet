# NFL-DataSet
This is the NFL dataset found on Kaggle.
The point of this dataset is to use it to predict the yards that would be gained
by certain play conditions. My script shows how you would deal with multiple 
different data types and missing data in the dataframe. as well as implimented a
random forest. However the random forest will be changed in the future in favour
of a neural network.
